📄 Document Change Analyzer

A backend service that compares two versions of a document and detects whether the document has changed in a meaningful way.

This project is useful for comparing things like:

📜 Privacy Policies
📑 Terms & Conditions
🏢 Company policies
📝 Any versioned text documents

🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
🐍 Python – main programming language
🤗 Hugging Face (Sentence Transformers) – to understand text meaning
🚀 BentoML – to turn the logic into a real API service

🤗 Hugging Face Usage
Computers do not understand English text directly. They understand numbers. 
To solve this, this project uses a Hugging Face embedding model:
Model used: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
This model converts text into numeric vectors (embeddings) that represent the meaning of the text.

🔢 What Embeddings Do in This Project
Document Version 1 → converted into numbers
Document Version 2 → converted into numbers

These numeric vectors are then compared using cosine similarity.
📈 High similarity score → meaning is mostly the same
📉 Low similarity score → meaning has changed

Based on the similarity score, the project classifies the change as:
✅ minor or no change
⚠️ major change

🚀 BentoML Usage
BentoML is used to wrap all the logic into a production-style service.
With BentoML:
The core logic is written in a service.py file
A service class is defined
An API endpoint (analyze) is exposed
The service can be started using a single command
This makes the project usable as an API, not just a script.

⚙️ How the Service Works (High Level)
1.The service receives two text documents as input
2.Hugging Face converts both documents into embeddings
3.The embeddings are compared
4.A similarity score is calculated
5.The service returns a JSON response containing:
 *similarity score
 *type of change (major or minor)

📁 Project Files
📄 service.py
Main production file

Contains BentoML service and API logic
📓 analysis.ipynb
Used for experimentation and explanation
Not required for running the service
📝 Policy_v1.txt, Policy_v2.txt

🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
Using Hugging Face pretrained models in a practical way
Converting text into embeddings for semantic comparison
Building a production-style API using BentoML
Separating experimentation from deployment logic

▶️ How to Use This Project

This service can be used to compare any two text documents, such as privacy policies or terms and conditions.
Convert both document versions into plain text format
Start the BentoML service
Send both document texts to the analyze API endpoint
Receive a response containing:
similarity score
classification of change (major or minor)

📝 Final Note

This project focuses on semantic document comparison, not text generation or chatbots.

It demonstrates how Hugging Face models can be integrated into a real backend service using BentoML to solve a practical real-world problem.
